# home-library

This is a fun home project I build for my wife and I to catalog our books. As of "First commit, base web app" you'll see the bare bones for this where you can add, edit, delete and search for books. You can set up a SQL database if you want to store your input, but otherwise this is currently just a fun toy. I used the MVC template in Visual Studio, so a lot of the boilerplate was done for me and as such might seem pretty bland (ready for you to branch and edit!).

More info coming soon!
